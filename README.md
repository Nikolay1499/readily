# Readily

A Flutter project that uses Firebase ML kit to detect words out of images. This application was created for students in first to forth grade 
in Bulgaria who have a monthly exercise on the number of words they can read in a minute. The idea was to automate everything and help the teachers.
After the timer has reached zero the students have to take a photo of the page and click on the first and last words that they have read and the app saves they score.
